# Roadmap for Future Work

Funding for this project is still uncertain and thus any future directions may depend upon relevant stakeholders. Suggested extensions include

- Integration with existing JPL data systems (state dictionary, helix directly, PEF from Merlin/Raven, etc ...)
- Integration with existing JPL simulation systems
- Compile to SMT backend for effecient verifiction
  - Automatic Bounded Model Checking againt simulation models (as F.S.A instead of concrete traces)
  - Followup by inductive synthesis of flight rules by example
- Natural Language Processing assistance for translation from helix to formal rule
- Better IDE style tooling
- Greater Settings/customizability
- Mobile Support
- Addition of operators
- Improvement of syntax
